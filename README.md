# Types of Hierarchy?

1. Traditional Hierarchy: "top-down"
2. Flatter Organizations: There is some form of hierarchy, but there are open lines present for communication and collaboration
3. Flat Organizations: No job titles, seniorities, and managerial division structure
4. Flatarchies: highly dynamic, somewhere in between traditional hierarchies and flat organizations
5. Holocratic Organizations: "Holo", meaning "whole" and "cratic" means "to rule or govern"; it is the rule of all.
