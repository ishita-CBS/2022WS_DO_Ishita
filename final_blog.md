## Introduction:

Human organisations appear to be dominated by hierarchies. From the Catholic Church, to the Military, to the majority of organisations, we find these pyramid-like structures everywhere, to the point that many of us believe Hierarchy is a "Natural Order." However, the word hierarchy now has an almost negative meaning. Many criticisms are launched against hierarchical organisational forms, and several alternatives are proposed. However, when confronted with the notion itself, it is difficult to simply declare that "hierarchy is evil" and jump on a totally other system... since, to date, I claim that no scalable system is complete without hierarchical arrangement. There is a doubt about whether Hierarchy is a natural order or not, but it is accepted by most that Hierarchies are the logical underpinning of inference and reasoning as well as the scaffolding for classification. 

## History:

The word Hierarchy dates back to ancient Greece. It seems to have been established by [Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite) in the 6th Century AD. The etymology of the word hierarchy comes from the Greek, ἱεραρχία (hierarchia, or “rule of a high priest”), composed of the roots ἱερεύς (hiereus, or “priest, sacrificer, diviner”) and ἀρχή (arche, or “beginning, origin” and other broad meanings) (Liddell and Scott 1897). The term hierarchy was first used to define the several degrees of the clerical polity during the Council of Trento. Hierarchies are the logical undergirding of inference and reasoning and classification. For the first time, we find the term used outside of a religious framework in the French Illuminism and the Encyclopedie. Hierarchy becomes a "Human Construct" that also applies to society. Several philosophers have reasoned on the notion of Hierarchy in various disciplines, particularly as a tool for categorization and taxonomies. Primarily, any organised structure with a subordinate connection is now referred to as a Hierarchy. 

When we talk about Human Organizations, we use the term Hierarchical Structure to illustrate the traditional pyramid organisational model, in which a boss coordinates the work of multiple subordinates. Many people believe that there is no alternative to this paradigm, which can only be minimised in its flaws. It's almost as though the first link with gods was never fully lost.

## Why do we have hierarchies:

Most animals on Earth exhibit Hierarchical Behaviors, which biologists and zoologists have observed. From ants to bonobos, it is common to believe that many creatures in Nature construct hierarchies. We've all seen films that emphasise the notion of the "Alpha Male," which is especially important among predators (Boehm, 2001). As Homo sapiens evolved, it appears that this collaborative attribute became increasingly "useful" from an evolutionary standpoint, particularly when the first groups of gatherers arose, with male hunters frequently functioning as the collective alpha (Calmettes and Weiss, 2017). Many people believe that a dominance hierarchy of persons with entirely self-centered qualities (the desire to dominate, resentment at being dominated) naturally shifts to equality as their language capacity grows. Language permits resentment of being dominated to foster the establishment of mutually advantageous coalitions that destabilise the alpha position for individuals, resulting in a phase shift in which a coalition of the entire or a portion of the population becomes dominant.

So, is humanity essentially hierarchical? The best response is that our nature is most likely mixed. We are predisposed to Hierarchy, but we have evolved a desire for Equality of opportunity. The point is that being inclusive requires deliberate activity, which we may overlook in times of peril or extreme stress. Another important factor to consider is that the evolution of our civilization has resulted in a complicated collection of numerous hierarchies. As a result, everyone of us belongs to several hierarchies at the same time. In our daily lives, we may be able to display our competitive spirit in certain realms while remaining egalitarian in others.

## Theories of hierarchy:

There are several categories of 'hierarchies.' One distinguishing feature is whether hierarchies are artificial or natural, with categorization based on 'natural sorts' (Bird and Tobin 2018; Peirce 1998b; Brakel 1998). Another factor to consider is whether hierarchies are built from the top down or from the bottom up (Czégel and Palla 2016; Ellis 2004; Lane 2006; Salthe 2012; Walker 2014; Yao 2009). Some argue that separate boundaries are required to identify objects (Durkheim and Mauss 2009), while information theory may assist clarify previously ambiguous differences (Ellis 2004; Wu 2013). Some mention purpose hierarchies (Herrmann-Pillath and Salthe 2011), which is another issue we shall return to. Some notions, such as 'flow hierarchies' (Luo et al. 2009), are included, although they are sequential rather than subsumptive.

Pumain identified distinct hierarchical objects and procedures in several disciplines while also asking common or cross-disciplinary questions (2006, 7). She proposed three ideas, which are not necessarily mutually incompatible, explaining why hierarchical hierarchies are so common in natural or social systems that we observe:

1. Hierarchies are just our way of observing and comprehending our surroundings.
2. In unrestricted dynamic random systems, hierarchies are spontaneous attractors.
3. For many optimization situations, hierarchies are the optimum answer.

## Hierarchy and Organisation:

Most models for integrating knowledge, know-how, competences, and abilities are hierarchical. The Functional Organization idea is based on a taxonomy of operations rather than an authority hierarchy. The division of labour concept (Durkheim, 1984) is nothing more than a hierarchical taxonomy applied to work tasks and activities.
But how can hierarchies emerge in organisations? Workers begin to organise in businesses when an entrepreneur begins to hire people, according to Ronald Coase's seminal paper The Nature of the Firm. According to classical economic theory, there should be no need for such an organisation in the existence of perfect markets. However, Coase recognised that the birth of a business was inextricably related to the imperfect market and the reality that internal transaction costs within an organisation would be lower than market transaction costs. These decreased transaction costs are mostly obtained as a result of the firm's employment of a hierarchical principle: the entrepreneur may command and organise the work of its workers, who carry out directions.

However, according to Gerard Fairtlough, this is a misunderstanding since we tend to mix up two essential ideas that both use the word "Organisation." An organisation is a collection of individuals who work together for a common goal. Organization is a type of action that involves the establishment of discipline and order (Fairtlough, 2007).
In his opinion, there are three methods to get things done in an organisation. He named this triarchy, and below is a summary of its components.
1. Hierarchy
2. Heterarchy, is a type of organisation that is typically seen in professional-service businesses, such as partnerships of accountants or attorneys, in which crucial decisions are made jointly by all of the partners.
3. Responsible autonomy, in this case, a person or a group has the autonomy to determine what to do but is held accountable for the decision's consequences.
According to Fairtlough, the main issue is not that we are programmed to operate in a hierarchy, but that we believe it is the only way to get things done.

## Hierarchy and Power:

The issue with Hierarchy arises when it is related with power and is utilised to save energy. This is where Fairtlough's comment of misunderstanding gets dangerous: when we mistake Hierarchy as the only method to govern an organisation using command and control concepts.

How is this accomplished? Typically, by segmenting data and avoiding transparency. When few individuals at the top can truly hold on to the majority of information and only segregate parts of it from the rest of the organisation, the poisonous consequences of Hierarchy become apparent. The greatest noticeable impact occurs when the organisational structure also serves as a communication channel.

## Hierarchy and Communication Flows:

Top-down communication is facilitated by hierarchical structures. Centuries of conflict have demonstrated that armies may be quite beneficial in this type of organisation. The issue arises when feedback loops are required to move communication upward. When bureaucrats at every level seek to keep some of the information power, things may slow down and become stuck.
This lack of communication, as well as the lack of openness and power, has resulted in a strong anti-hierarchy feeling that is spreading over the world. When we reject Hierarchy indiscriminately on that premise, there is a risk that we will lose our essential ability to think and prioritise at the same time. 2018 (Knuchel).

## Why is Hierarchy so complex?

There is nothing intrinsically wrong with hierarchies. The truth is that Nature's default mode of operation is Complex Adaptive Systems. This may be translated as "a system in which enormous networks of components with no central control and simple operating principles give birth to complex collective behaviour, sophisticated information processing, and adaptability through learning or evolution." Mitchell (2011)

In the framework of a mechanical system meant to leverage control and preserve balance, hierarchies operate well. However, when changing circumstances are introduced, the benefit of complex adaptive systems becomes clear: they are excellent at utilising collective learning to adjust to changing surroundings.
Our democratic state is an excellent example of a human organisation founded on Network principles. Power is not concentrated in a single entity; rather, it is diffused across multiple. And democracies encourage the formation of new types of collaboration and relationships. As a result, new nodes are produced (and deleted) on a regular basis. Is democracy an ideal system? Most likely not. However, it has shown to be highly durable thus far.

Finally, the optimal approach is likely to be a situational hierarchy in which each organisation travels on a slider between full self-management and full top-down Hierarchy and modifies this based on the environmental condition.

## Conclusion:

In this blog, I attempted to show a few facts critical to understanding the notion of Hierarchies.

1. Initially, the word hierarchy is associated with religious circumstances.
2. Homo Sapiens is a species that is more egalitarian than hierarchical. However, with the formation of contemporary civilizations, some control principles were forced by humans to adopt hierarchical forms in the society.
3. Hierarchy is an effective technique for developing and maintaining a social narrative.
4. Hierarchy is a method of organising information. When applied to an organisation, we prefer to combine the Power element with the human need to make sense of information by employing taxonomies and hierarchies.
5. Alternate solution to Hierarchy can be classified as Heterarchy or Responsible Autonomy clusters. However, the difficulty is how to expand organisations that comply to these ideals.

Traditional top-down hierarchies are unsuitable in many present-day environments, because continual adaptation and change may be necessary. However, in order to expand an organisation, we must completely discard the hierarchical idea. In any event, there will be times when they will be required.
I wanted to explain on the concept "Hierarchy a 'natural' order" from many various perspectives that are required to appreciate it holistically, because it is all too easy to dismiss Hierarchy as unnecessary without having a comprehensive picture of the alternative.
