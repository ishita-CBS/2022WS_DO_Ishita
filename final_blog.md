# Introduction:

Human organisations appear to be dominated by hierarchies. From the Catholic Church, to the Military, to the majority of organisations, we find these pyramid-like structures everywhere, to the point that many of us believe Hierarchy is a "Natural Order." However, the word hierarchy now has an almost negative meaning. Many criticisms are launched against hierarchical organisational forms, and several alternatives are proposed. However, when confronted with the notion itself, it is difficult to simply declare that "hierarchy is evil" and jump on a totally other system... since, to date, I claim that no scalable system is complete without hierarchical arrangement. Hierarchies are the logical underpinning of inference and reasoning as well as the scaffolding for classification.

# History

The word Hierarchy dates back to ancient Greece. It seems to have been established by [Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite) in the 6th Century AD. The etymology of the word hierarchy comes from the Greek, ἱεραρχία (hierarchia, or “rule of a high priest”), composed of the roots ἱερεύς (hiereus, or “priest, sacrificer, diviner”) and ἀρχή (arche, or “beginning, origin” and other broad meanings) (Liddell and Scott 1897; Van Hove 1910). The term hierarchy was first used to define the several degrees of the clerical polity during the Council of Trento. Hierarchies are the logical undergirding of inference and reasoning and classification. For the first time, we find the term used outside of a religious framework in the French Illuminism and the Encyclopedie. Hierarchy becomes a "Human Construct" that also applies to society. Several philosophers have reasoned on the notion of Hierarchy in various disciplines, particularly as a tool for categorization and taxonomies. Primarily, any organised structure with a subordinate connection is now referred to as a Hierarchy.                     When we talk about Human Organizations, we use the term Hierarchical Structure to illustrate the traditional pyramid organisational model, in which a boss coordinates the work of multiple subordinates. Many people believe that there is no alternative to this paradigm, which can only be minimised in its flaws. It's almost as though the first link with gods was never fully lost.
